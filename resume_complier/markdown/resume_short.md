Education
---------

2016-2020 (expected)
:   **BTech, Electrical Engineering**; Indian Institute of Technology (Hyderabad)

    Currently pursuing Bachelor of Technology, third year and Honors
    in Electrical Engineering.

    Current CGPA : 8.8

Projects
----------

**Facial Recognition with OpenCV, DLib and a flavor of FaceNet**

Implimented a real-time face recognition on Web-cam footage

* Achieved 98% accuracy on a custom made dataset.

* Face recognition on videos was achieved at 24 FPS. The input was a 60FPS capable 720p webcam

* [GitHub repo](http://www.example.com)

**Gait recognition with Keras**

Implimented a gait-recognition deep-net by cascading two networks - HumanPoseNN and GaitNN.

* Achieved an accuracy of 92.8%

* [GitHub repo](http://www.example.com)

**Lung Tumor Segmentation**

Worked on segmentation of lung tumors on DICOM images as a part of IEEE VIP-CUP problem statement (VIP-CUP 2018).

**Inter IIT Tech Meet 2017**

Worked on the Soldier Support Problem statement offered by DRDO. Finished 7th overall across all IITs.

* Gesture Recognition:
Made a functional gesture recognition module attached to a glove, capable of
capturing any hand movement in 3-D space.

  * The module could guess 39 out of 43 gestures specified by DRDO, with
    probability 1

* AD-HOC Localization:
Implemented localization of Raspberry PIs in an Ad-hoc network to locate and pin-
point any device in the network.

    * The module was capable of tracking nodes in a radius of 100m in closed room
      environment and around 200m in an outdoor environment.


**Smart Meter**

Made a working prototype smart energy meter capable of tracking energy consumption and relaying it to a server in real-time.
